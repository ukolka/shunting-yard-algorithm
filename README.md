Shunting yard algorithm
=======================

Object oriented implementation of the Shunting-yard algorithm using Python 2.7.
Parses mathematical expression in infix notation to produce Reverse Polish Notation.
I just decided to make it a bit more readable and extensible than most implementations I've seen so far.
Algorithm is taken from [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm "Shunting yard algorithm").
